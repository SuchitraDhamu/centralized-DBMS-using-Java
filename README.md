# centralized-DBMS-using-Java
- Created a light-weight centralized database management system (e.g. metadata management, data structure design, data storing, retrieval, building database and logs, analysis, and security) with custom database structure for in memory operations using ArrayList, HashMap.
- Created regular expressions to identify the create, insert and delete sql queries to process the command.
- Created logic to generate the metadata file with custom delimiter - "|" to store table name, column names etc.
- Developed the logic to create the SQL dump extracted using the metadata files and combining the information contained in schema files to list the updates made on the database along with structure and values.
